[Meeting Notes](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1E_gh956eETLY7uBk27NX-Mp3P9KKm9QV?usp=sharing)

## Goals
- Work as a team through the DBTL cycle 
- Practice experimental planning, analysis and data collection 
- Learn how to interpret this data for our Proof of Concept and to tell a story on our Wiki 
- Learn essential lab skills for synthetic biology 
- Adhere to lab safety and diligent note taking during experiments 
- Develop problem-solving skills to identify and address issues that may arise during experiments 
- Foster collaboration and communication with other sub teams
