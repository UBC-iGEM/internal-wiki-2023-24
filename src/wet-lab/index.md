## Notebook
For each notebook entry, copy the template [here](https://github.com/UBC-iGEM/internal-wiki-2023-24/blob/main/src/wet-lab/notebook/month.md). Additionally, add a weekly summary to the [main](notebook/index.md) notebook page.
## Goals
- Work as a team through the DBTL cycle 
- Practice experimental planning, analysis and data collection 
- Learn how to interpret this data for our Proof of Concept and to tell a story on our Wiki 
- Learn essential lab skills for synthetic biology 
- Adhere to lab safety and diligent note taking during experiments 
- Develop problem-solving skills to identify and address issues that may arise during experiments 
- Foster collaboration and communication with other sub teams
