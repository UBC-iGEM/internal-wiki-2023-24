# Summer Symposium

## Overview
UBC iGEM team’s summer symposium initiative will invite high school students to pitch their innovative synthetic biology ideas, fostering a platform for creativity, learning, and exchange. This event will aim to connect young minds with experts in the field, encouraging discussion, feedback, and the development of students’ concepts in synthetic biology. 

## Context and Scope
Centered around a symposium format, this initiative allows students to showcase their ideas in front of a panel of synthetic biology experts and peers, promoting an environment of learning and constructive critique. This event will be tailored specifically for high school students interested in synthetic biology, aiming to bridge the gap between academic knowledge and real-world application. 

## Goals and non-goals
### Goals
- To stimulate interest in synthetic biology among high school students
- Allow the creative process of idea generation and pitching
- Provide a supportive platform for students to receive expert feedback
- Enhance learning experience
- Encourage further exploration of STEM fields 

### Non-Goals
- Providing in-depth research opportunities
- Direct implementation of the pitched ideas 
- Extending the initiative to include participants beyond high school students
- To cover areas outside of synthetic biology

## Plan
- Invite high school students during Let’s Talk Science visits
- Host potential workshops focused on the fundamentals of synthetic biology and effective pitch techniques (can be done via Zoom)
- Have students submit their synbio project ideas
- Review submissions and give feedback
- Finalize logistics for the symposium
- Host the Summer symposium!
