# User Manual
## Overview
The User Manual is a document that allows for scientists to use our product (DNA synthesis and software system) in an understandable and safe way. 

Note that this is a working guideline; as the nature of the User Manual is based on an integration of all subteams, plans may change depending on the progress of Wet and Dry lab. 
## Context and Scope
As a foundational advance project with a clear deliverable in the form of a software that can be used to decode a DNA storage system, the deliverable should be as easy to handle as possible; in order to increase the accessibility and usability of our product, we need a manual that clearly describes the product in a step by step manner. The user manual should also include an extensive safety section in order to outline our deliverable as a safe product to use. 
## Goals and non-goals
### Goals 
To clearly outline how to use our product
To clearly outline the safety implications and hazards of the product 

### Non-Goals
A summary of our whole project; engineering design process, wet lab details, human practices initiatives, should not be included 
Only relevant information will be included (context)
## Plan
Sections to include in the document: 
* Introduction 
* Quick intro of our team + project 
* Explain any important components (TdT, vectors, software)
*In what context the kit should be used
* Materials 
* User Guide 
* Biosafety
* Safety data sheet 
* Handling information
