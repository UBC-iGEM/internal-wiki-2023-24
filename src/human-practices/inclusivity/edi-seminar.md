# EDI Seminar
## Overview
Science is a collaborative process; this means that inclusivity to provide as many perspectives as possible is needed. Human Practices will focus on the aspects of what it means to uphold Human Practice values in a research setting by hosting a panel discussion with members of the EDI community. 
## Context and Scope
Decolonizing research and being inclusive is needed in the science community in order to create a platform where ideas are shared equitably and fairly; this ensures that all voices are heard and contributes to discussion regarding societal and ethical implications of science.

Human practices will be leading an EDI Panel discussion that focuses on Human Practices values. 
## Goals and non-goals
### Goals 
To promote a platform of discourse on what it means to practice humanity within research 
To promote discussion on how we can focus research on inclusivity; both within the research community as well as the wider community
To highlight voices that may have been previously marginalized 
To discuss ways that we can make research more accessible and inclusive; decolonizing research
To provide a safe space where natural and authentic discussion can happen
Encourage the thinking of the implications of science

### Non-Goals 
To enforce ideas on others - this platform lends itself for us to bring the idea of Human Practices onto the table; it is up to the panel to do with the information as they wish 
## Plan
We will invite 2-4 guest speakers with EDI backgrounds to come in to the seminar
The first part of the seminar will be consist of an introduction for everyone
The professors and their research 
an introduction of the Human Practices team and what Human Practices is 
The second part will lend itself as a platform for discussion on what Human Practices is, guided by questions created by the Human Practices subteam 
After the premeditated questions are over, questions can be asked by the audience 
After the session is over and time and venue allows, mingling may be allowed.
