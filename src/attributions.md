# Attributions

iGEM requires everyone who contributed to the project to fill out the attributions form. For members on the team, leads and co-directors will be checking the Master Tracker to verify that your attributions are honest. Wording is important; don't say more than what you actually did.

## External Contributions

As we start reaching out to external contacts who are willing to help us, once they have given us advice, please either

1. make an [issue](https://github.com/UBC-iGEM/internal-wiki-2023-24/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=add-a-project-related-resource.md&title=Add+resource%3A+%5Btopic%5D) to track their name down in our internal wiki so Lucy or a wiki liaison can add them to the attributions page; you can make another issue to add updates to the external contact throughout the season

<iframe src="https://scribehow.com/embed/Add_External_Advisor_to_Internal_Wiki__eiTNhbDQSK6C6WDG7nXoqg" width="100%" height="640" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></iframe>

2. or directly edit the page yourself with your external contact and update that entry throughout the season.

The earlier we record down an external contact the easier it is to track so we can add them to our competition wiki.
