# For leads

Writing clear documentation for other subteams and your members is of utmost importance. Please read [How to Document](index.md) if you have not already.

As mentioned, having [concrete, small steps (with deliverables) towards our goal](../index.md#concrete-small-steps-with-deliverables-towards-our-goal) is very important to reaching our end of having a well integrated and working project for the iGEM jamboree. When planning for your subteam, here are the steps you should take.

1. Check out the iGEM requirements for all subteams.
2. Create clear goals for your team on the page at the link: /[your-subteam]/index.html. For wet lab this would be [here](../wet-lab/index.md). Categorize goals as either MVP goals or "for-fun" goals.
    - make sure your goals align with iGEM requirements.
4. Consider your subteam members' strengths and preferences and assign members to tasks accordingly.
5. Create a PR when you are done writing, and get at least one other lead from **another subteam** to review your plans.

These goals should be continually iterated upon; if you are finding that your subteam has trouble reaching these goals or reaches them too quickly, reevaluate your goals as these issues arise. 

Here is a template for each goal:
