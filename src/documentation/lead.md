# For leads

<!-- toc -->

Writing clear documentation for other subteams and your members is of utmost importance. Please read [How to Document](index.md) if you have not already.

## Overview Page

As mentioned, having [concrete, small steps (with deliverables) towards our goal](index.md#concrete-small-steps-with-deliverables-towards-our-goal) is very important to demonstrating the E-DBTL cycle so we can have a well integrated and working project for the iGEM jamboree. When planning for your subteam, please write an Overview page. Below are the steps you will take.

Add everything that is listed below at the page: /[your-subteam]/index.html. For wet lab this would be [here](../wet-lab/index.md).

1. Check out the iGEM requirements for all subteams. List the **gold, silver, bronze requirements** that must be met for your subteam. Link the related iGEM pages to each medal requirement.
2. Create **timeline** for your subteam. Use a table for this.
3. Create **clear goals** for your team on the page. Categorize goals based on medal requirement, MVP goals or "for-fun" goals and any other labels you deem useful.
   - These goals should be continually iterated upon; if you are finding that your subteam has trouble reaching these goals or reaches them too quickly, reevaluate your goals as these issues arise.
4. List all projects that will occur within your subteam.
5. Create a PR when you are done writing, and get at least one other lead from **another subteam** to review your plans.

These overview pages should be updated weekly based on new information and tasks/goals being completed.

Each overview page should have the following:

## Other pages

For each subteam, there are subsections created on the sidebar. These sections are one-to-one correspondences with the final wiki pages. As your subteam members popular these sections, it is your and the wiki liaisons' responsibilities to read over these pages and approve them as PRs come through. Everyone should be reading the Internal Wiki, but leads and wiki liaisons will be expected to have a larger hand in making sure documentation is well written.
