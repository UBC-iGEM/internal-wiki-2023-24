## Problem
Ubiquitous data storage in the form of "the cloud" is becoming an everyday norm, becoming the default method of saving all types of information, ranging from videos to photos and more. But data isn’t really in the cloud - it’s stored in giant buildings containing magnetic and optical media such as hard drives, with some buildings taking up "nearly 200 acres of land apiece" (cite). It is predicted that the world will generate around 180 zettabytes of information by 2025, with 22 zettabytes of data being shipped around between 2018 and 2025, 60% in the form of hard drives (cite). With the exponential increase of information creation and sharing, the scalability and capacity of magnetic and optical media cannot meet the demands of the near future. As of 2015, data centers account for around 2% of global energy usage, with individual data centers using as much energy as an airline; this value only grows (cite).

With advancements in DNA synthesis and sequencing, DNA poses a novel medium for information because it is:

- Dense: you can store all of the world’s information in a coffee cup! 
- Durable: it can be stored for millions of years in the correct conditions
- Energy efficient: [TODO]

However, DNA storage still faces bottlenecks in synthesis and sequencing. We hope to enhance synthesis with enzymatic DNA synthesis which has several advantages over chemical synthesis. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) elongates single stranded oligonucleotides by randomly adding different nucleotides. Moreover, TdT has a preference for the incorporation of some nucleotides over others, leading to increased rates of sequence-specific errors. TdT works only on single-stranded DNA, due to the enzyme’s structure. Thus, if secondary DNA structures form, synthesis efficiency is reduced. In essence, WT TdT isn’t selective enough by itself to perform accurate DNA Synthesis.

Previous iGEM teams have tackled this issue, with mixed results. The latest team, Aachen iGEM 2021, at most was able to encode and decode 15 nucleotides with 40% accuracy. As such, UBCV iGEM 2024 team is attempting to increase the accuracy of the encoding and decoding of larger sequences by using higher reaction temperatures with thermostable TdT as well as optimizing with alternative reagents the overall protocol in order to reduce the systematic and random errors. Big Biotech companies have gotten around these issues by engineering TdT and creating nucleotide complexes; but these are patented and out of the reach of the public.

Additionally, our team hopes to use software to enhance the accuracy of information stored in DNA with error correcting codes, parallelize the synthesis process with microfluidics, and quantify our wet labs work with protein and math modelling. Finally, we hope our project helps to demystify concepts in computation, storage systems and DNA through educational efforts and user-orientated interviews of our graphical user interface. We hope to use the multidisciplinary nature of synthetic biology to enhance synthesis and retrieval steps of DNA storage.
